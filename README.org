** What does org-hyperscheduler do?

org-hyperscheduler presents a web UI that allows agenda entries to be visualized and moved around easily.


Here's a typical agenda (~C-c a a~):

[[file:images/org-agenda.png]]

and here is how it's visualized in org-hyperscheduler:

[[file:images/org-hs-ui.png]]

- blue entries are coming from an external calendar (such as [[https://github.com/kidd/org-gcal.el][org-gcal]]).
- purple entries are part of standard org-agenda.


The user is free to modify entries or move them around provided =org-hyperschedule-readonly-mode= is disabled.

** Planning A Day

When planning a day, it's easy to start with a list of tasks:

and then visualize them to ensure that capacity is available:

** Screen Cast


Real quick demo of what the package does:

** Installation

org-hyperschedule is *not* currently available in MELPA. Once the package matures, it will be added.

For now you can either download the source and install it manually or with ~use-package~ and [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]]:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-hyperscheduler
  :straight
  ( :repo "dmitrym0/org-hyperscheduler"
    :host github
    :type git
    :files ("*")))
#+end_src


You can then invoke ~M-x org-hyperscheduler-open~ to invoke the web view.


** Configuration


Use ~M-x customize-group org-hyperscheduler~ to configure this module.


*** Read only mode

org-hyperscheduler is able to update entries in Emacs when using the web UI. To suppor this functionality, org-hyperscheduler must create IDs for each scheduled entry. If you are not ok with org-hyperscheduler modifying your data, keep ~org-hyperscheduler-readonly-mode~ turned on. In this mode you can visualize your agenda, but cannot make any changes in web UI.

*** Hiding calendar entries from org-roam

org-roam treats all entries with an ~:ID:~ property as roam nodes. This is not what I wanted. org-roam excludes all entries with the G

See ~org-hyperscheduler-exclude-from-org-roam~ through ~M-x customize-group org-hyperscheduler~ or

~(setq org-hyperscheduler-exclude-from-org-roam t)~

**Note**: Read only mode must be disabled for this to take effect.

** Development


*** Running tests

1. Install [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]] (~brew install cask~).
2. Run ~cask~ to install dependencies.
3. Run ~cask exec buttercup -L .~

**** org-roam-ui

org-hyperscheduler was heavily inspired by [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]]. If you're using [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam]] it's worth adding org-roam-ui.

**** calfw

[[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-calfw][calfw]] is a (textmode) calendaring framwork for emacs. I found it somewhat late into the development of org-hyperscheduler. If I found it earlier, I may have skipepd developing this.
